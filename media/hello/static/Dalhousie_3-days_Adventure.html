DAY 1
Start off early from Delhi/Chandigarh/(or any place nearby). Try to reach Dalhousie by evening so as to not to miss the beautiful sunset amid the hills.
Take some time to settle, freshen up and get outside to discover the local markets in Dalhousie.
If you reach early then you can visit Panchpula which is just half an hour drive from Dalhousie.

DAY 2
Have breakfast and take the road towards Khajjiar, few kilometers ahead take a detour from LakadMandi towards Kalatop. This is a beautiful and an hour long trek and worth going. The views are just awesome from the top.
After the trek set off towards Khajjiar, enjoy lunch and evening tea amidst the green meadows of Khajjiar.
You can either stay here for the night or can go back to Dalhousie.

DAY 3
Check out from the hotel and enroute towards your home â€˜cause its time to say goodbye to this lovely place.
